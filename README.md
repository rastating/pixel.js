Pixel.js
=========
A simple and flexible HTML5 and JavaScript powered game engine.

### Where can I find the documentation of the engine?
The documentation as well as FAQs and a thorough 'Getting Started' guide can all be found on the website at http://rastating.github.io/pixel.js/

### How do I build Pixel.js?
Pixel.js, as you may have noticed, is split up into a number of different modules in order to ease the process of maintaining the code. In order to compile these modules into a single file you simply need to run the Python script that can be found in the build directory.

This script requires that you have the SlimIt minifier package for Python, which can be found here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/slimit
